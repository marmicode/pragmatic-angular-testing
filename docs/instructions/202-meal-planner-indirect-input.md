## 🎯 Goal: Sync meals from the `MealRepository` to the `MealPlanner`

On startup, the `MealPlanner` should fetch meals from the `MealRepository`.

### 📝 Steps with a Fake

#### 1. Run tests:

```sh
pnpm test
```

#### 2. Use the `setUpMealPlanner()` function instead of `createMealPlanner()` in order to configure the spy before creating the `MealPlanner`.

#### 3. Check that the `MealPlanner` contains the meals from the `MealRepository`.

#### 4. Checkout the implementation as mentioned at step 0 if you didn't do it already.

### 📝 Steps with a Spy

#### 1. Run tests:

```sh
pnpm test
```

#### 2. Remove the fake and create & provide the spy instead. _(🔗 [Tip: Create & provide a type-safe spy](./201-meal-planner-indirect-output.md#-tip-create--provide-a-type-safe-spy-with-vitest))_

#### 3. Use the `setUpMealPlanner()` function instead of `createMealPlanner()` in order to configure the spy before creating the `MealPlanner`.

#### 4. Check that the `MealPlanner` contains the meals from the `MealRepository`.

#### 5. Check that the spy was called properly.

#### 6. [optional] Checkout the implementation if you've opted for TDD option:.

```sh
pnpm cook checkout-impl
```
