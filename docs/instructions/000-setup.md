## 🎪 Downgrade to Jest

By default, this workspace uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), but you can downgrade to [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) if you prefer:

```sh
# You will have to run this command each time you reset your local changes
pnpm downgrade-to-jest
```

_Note that the solutions are compatible with both test runners._
